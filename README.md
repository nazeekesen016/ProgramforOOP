# ProgramforOOP
For this project I use JavaFX and  MySQL database to store user data via JDBC API.
This JavaFX application will have a registration form where users can enter their details and then submit the form. When the user submits the form, the form data will be stored in MySQL database via JDBC API.

This program is an example of a registration form. Program is pretty simple but also it match all the requirements mentioned by teacher. 

How it works? 
After we run a program we can see a JavaFX application. There are name, Email ID and password.

After that we  make sure our program works, then we have to write our name, Email and password. 

If you write eerything correctly in each block the program will Welcome you.

In case if something went wrong, it will show a error, so you will know what should you fix.
